# NN-and-DL-course
# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course Repository

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) for various topics covered in the Neural Networks (NN) and Deep Learning (DL) course. The course explores a wide range of deep learning architectures and techniques listed below. I've done the assignments in collaboration with my teammate Mohammad Vaziri.

## Contents

The repository is organized into folders for each topic:

- [MLPs](MLP/): Multi-Layer Perceptrons
- [CNNs](CNN/): Convolutional Neural Networks
- [RCNNs](RCNN/): Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks
- [RNNs](RNN/): Recurrent Neural Networks
- [Transformers](Transformer/): Transformer Models
- [GANs](GAN/): Generative Adversarial Networks

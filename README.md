# NN-and-DL-course
# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course Repository

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) for various topics covered in the Neural Networks (NN) and Deep Learning (DL) course. The course explores a wide range of deep learning architectures and techniques, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Contents

The repository is organized into folders for each topic:

- [MLPs](MLPs/): Multi-Layer Perceptrons
- [CNNs](CNNs/): Convolutional Neural Networks
- [RCNNs](RCNNs/): Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks
- [RNNs](RNNs/): Recurrent Neural Networks
- [Transformers](Transformers/): Transformer Models
- [GANs](GANs/): Generative Adversarial Networks

Each folder contains Jupyter Notebook files and potentially other related resources for the respective topic.

## Getting Started
